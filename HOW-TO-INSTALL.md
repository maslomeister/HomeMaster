2. Go to Desktop mode of your steam deck and download latest release of the plugin from [Releases](https://github.com/maslomeister/HomeMaster/releases)
3. After installation, open quick access menu by pressing `...` button on you deck and go to decky
4. Go to ⚙️ **_Settings_**, then **_General_**. Scroll down to **_OTHER_** and enable **_Developer mode_**

If after plugin installation, selecting collection and scrolling around in the Home page nothing doesn't seem to happen, you may need to **_Restart Steam_** from Power options.

At this point you can disable **_Developer mode_** if you want to.
